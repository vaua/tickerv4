**Background**

Ticker v4 is an attempt to make a biologically inspired simulation engine. 

**High Goals**
- Implemented and rest points

Through earlier simulations, I have drawn the conclusion that the most important element of these simulations is the evaluation speed. As positive mutations are seldom (as they should be), the pace of evolution is very, very slow once the world becomes big enough to give place for meaningsful evolution and exploration.
Therefore, the main goal of building ticker v4 was to create a meaningful simulation that should be able to execute 1 million animals per second. So one million ticks per second. On available (free) hardware. As part of preparation, I have verified that I can execute one million "void" ticks per second (where no calculation is done). So, the challenge becomes: how much slower will the execution become once menaingful calcultion are done? A meningful calculation includes both calculations that world executes, to be able to provide animals with correct input, as well as calucatons that animals must execute in order to react on given input, in accordance with the genes inherited.


**Biology**
- What is implemented in the world
- World, animals, DNA, connections, dimensions, calculations
- How are animals made from DNA

**Technical solutions**
- Server client architecture
- Different levels and data models
- Simplifications for calculability
- Found issues

**Discusisons**
- Hade the goals been met?
- Can any theoretical conclusions be made?
- Next step. What is the next step to reach the challenge posted?
